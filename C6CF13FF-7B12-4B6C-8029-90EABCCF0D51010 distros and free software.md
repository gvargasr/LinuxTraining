## Quick Lesson: Understanding Linux Distributions and Free Software

### Linux Distributions
A __Linux distribution__ is a complete operating system that includes the Linux kernel, system utilities, and other software. It is designed to provide users with a functional and cohesive environment for various computing tasks.

#### Key Components of a Linux Distribution:
1. __Kernel__: The core part of the operating system that manages hardware resources.
2. __Shell__: A command-line interface that allows users to interact with the operating system.
3. __Programs__: Various applications and utilities that provide functionality to the user.

### Common Linux Distributions
- __Ubuntu Linux LTS__: Based on __Debian__, it offers long-term support (__LTS__) versions with regular security updates.
- __Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)__: An __enterprise-grade__ distribution known for its robust support and __security updates__.
- __CentOS__: Derived from Red Hat Enterprise Linux (__RHEL__), CentOS is ideal for those who want to use RHEL knowledge __without paying__ for a subscription.
- __Debian GNU/Linux__: Known for its stability and extensive package repository.

| Debian             | Red Hat (RHEL)                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| ubuntu (most used) | redhat (paid professional for server) |
|                    | Fedora (for end-user, edge tech)      |
|                    | Centos(free version of redhat)        |
|                    |                                       |

### Free Software (Libre)
Free Software refers to software that grants users the freedom to run, modify, distribute, and share it. This concept is governed by specific licenses that ensure these freedoms are maintained.

#### Characteristics of Free Software:
1. __Modifiable by Anyone__: Users can change the source code as needed.
2. __Conditions for Modifying and Distributing__: Defined by Free Software licenses like GPL (General Public License).
3. __Copyleft Principle__: Ensures that modified versions of free software remain free.

### Important Concepts
- __Copyleft__: A licensing principle requiring derivative works to be distributed under the same license as the original work.
- __Enterprise Grade Distributions__:
  - Ubuntu LTS
  - Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  - CentOS
